## Abstract

Data samples generated by several real world processes are dynamic in nature i.e., their characteristics vary with time.
Thus it is not possible to train and tackle all possible distributional shifts between training and inference, using the
host of transfer learning methods in literature. In this paper, we tackle this problem of adapting to domain shift at
inference time i.e., we do not change the training process, but quickly adapt the model at test-time to handle any
domain shift. For this, we propose to enforce consistency of predictions of data sampled in the vicinity of test sample
on the image manifold. On a host of test scenarios like dealing with corruptions (CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C), and
domain adaptation (VisDA-C), our method is at par or significantly outperforms previous methods.
