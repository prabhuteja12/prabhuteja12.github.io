**Hi! I'm Prabhu Teja,**

I'm a Research Assistant at [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch) and a PhD student at
[EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch).

## About Me!

I'm currently working in the [Machine Learning group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/machine-learning) at [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch) in Martigny, Switzerland. My thesis advisor is [Dr. Fran&ccedil;ois Fleuret](https://fleuret.org/francois).

My research is on the topic of Semantic Segmentation. In particular, I work on the topic of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation.

I've had a variety of experiences in the past. I started off in online handwriting recognition, moved on to medical imaging processing and most recently, worked on advertisement domain problems during my stint at Amazon.

Here is my [CV](/cv).
