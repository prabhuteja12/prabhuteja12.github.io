I've been interested in various things over various periods! My deepest interest has been a form of Indian Classical Music called [Carnatic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music). With my introduction to it as a child it took nearly a decade for me to take any interest in it. I have a large collection of such music probably ranging from early 1950s to the current era, carefully collected over the years and curated and listened to time and again. Talk to me if you want to know more about it!

In the ancient times, I [blogged](https://monarchsmind.blogspot.com/) for a small while. I would like to keep it going,
however laziness and life get in the way of doing so.
